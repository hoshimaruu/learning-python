Type casting is an approach of converting an implicit data type to a specific data type
e.g.,
```python
age1 = 10
age2 = "20"
int_age2 = int(age2) # from "20" to 20, String to float
print(age1 * int_age2) # age1 x age2 = 200
print(type(int_age2)) # int_age2 is an integer data type
print(type(age2)) # age2 is a string data type
```
