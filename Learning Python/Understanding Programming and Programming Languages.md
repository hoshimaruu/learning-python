What is **Programming?**
	*is the act of writing precise instructions that guide computers and devices to perform specific tasks. It's the blue print for digital action.*
	*A format set of rules (syntax and semantics) used to write instructions for computers. Unlike natural languages, these are strict and unambiguous. preventing errors.*

Why are there **so many programming languages exist**?
	*- Hundred of programming languages exist today, each meticulously designed for specific tasks, platforms, or programming philosophies*.

**Types of Programming Language:**
***Level of Abstraction**
- Machine Code
	- Compiled in binary form, directly interacts with hardware(GPU, CPU, Memory)
- Low-Level:
	- Similar to Machine Code, but written in letter form `e.g., std::cout`. Indirectly interacts with hardware, needed to compile first into Machine Code.
- High-Level:
	- Runs at the surface-level of the computer. Usually it has their own compiling engine `e.g., Python`. Not compiled in Machine Code (which it's slower since it doesn't interact with the hardware)
***Execution**
- Compiled Programming Languages:
	- Translated into Machine Code
	- Compiled before interpreted
- Interpreted Programming Languages:
	- Executed in a Virtual Engine (runs at a surface-level)
	- Interpreted before compiled
***By Structure / Paradigm**
- Procedural
	- Step-by-step instructions.
- Functional
	- Emphasizing pure functions and immutability.
- Object-Oriented
	- Organizing code into reusable objects.
- Scripting
	- Automating tasks, often interpreted.

**The Birth of Python: Why and Who Created It**
- A Solution to ABC's Limits
	- Created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum to overcome the limitation of the ABC Language, focusing on clarity and utility.
- Design for Extensibility
	- Python was designed for extensibility, readability, and ease of use, featuring robust exception handling.
- Accessibility & Efficiency

**What its Identity?**
Python's design philosophy prioritizes programmer productivity and code readability, making it a flexible tool for diverse programming.
- *High-Level Abstraction*
- *Interpreted Execution*
- *Multi-paradigm Support*
	- Seamlessly supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles.

**Why it's Perfect for Beginners?**
These features combine to make Python an ideal entry point into the world of programming, empowering new learners to build confidence quickly.
- *Simple, English-like syntax*
- *Automated Memory Management* 
- *Supportive Community*
	- welcoming community provides abundant tutorials, forums, and support resources, fostering quick learning.

**It's Advantages**
- Concise & Efficient Code
	- Task achievable in significantly fewer lines than Java or C++.
- Extensive Libraries
	- Vast standard and third-party library available for diverse applications, from web development to AI.
